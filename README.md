## Summary

 It is true what they say: "React will make you a better JavaScripter".  I've enjoyed using it, as well as Hooks and Context, to build this app. I'm looking forward to using it again in my next project. 

 Bootstrap is a very convenient way to quicklyl make a presentable UI; however, I wish there were a way to use it without mucking up the markup so much.
